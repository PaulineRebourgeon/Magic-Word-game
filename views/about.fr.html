<p>Magic Word was created as part of the <i>Innovalangues </i>project at Stendhal University in Grenoble, France. <i>Innovalangues</i> is the only language oriented project within IDEFI (Initiatives in Excellence for Innovative Education) and will run from 2012 to 2018. This first version of Magic Word was designed and developed by two students of linguistics in the Language Industries master’s program, Pauline Rebourgeon and Christine Lutian, for their end-of-study professional project. Initially conceived for learners of English or Italian, the <i>Innovalanges</i> project hopes to adapt Magic Word for additional languages.</p>

<p>Magic Word is a word search game developed as a learning aid for foreign language learners. It is a serious game inspired by the classic word game, Boggle®, in which players have three minutes to search for words in a grid of letters. Its objectives are the following: to support a deeper understanding of the target language and to improve linguistic skills, both lexical and morphological; to provide an environment of interaction between members, both language learners and native speakers; to facilitate language learning through fun and competition.</p>

<p>The game has two modes, <i>solo</i> and <i>versus</i>.  In the <i>solo</i> mode, players can play as many rounds independently as they wish, whereas in the <i>versus</i> mode, players go head-to-head and play three rounds. At the end of a round, and to add to the learning experience, players can view definitions of all the possible words in the grid, as well as see suggestions for words that they played that were not found in the dictionary. They can then choose to review words later by adding them to their own personal dictionary, the Wordbox. To encourage vocabulary acquisition, a word from a player’s Wordbox is selected at random to appear on the player’s homepage for further review.</p>
